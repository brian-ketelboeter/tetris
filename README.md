# My version of Tetris

Python Tetris uses pygame to create the two-dimensional game we all remember from childhood. To install, just download the four files and install pygame.
Can be run in any python interpreter.

The file structure is as follows: a main.py file where the main file is kept where the game loop is executed from and a folder containing the board.py, 
piece.py and constant.py files. The board.py file generates the playing board object while piece.py handles the creation and manipulation of the pieces. 
The constants.py file holds any constants (SQUARESIZE) etc.
